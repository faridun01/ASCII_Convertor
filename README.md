  Toggle buttons allow you to set binary digits interactively, updating the conversion in real time.

  Input in any of the fields (decimal, octal, hexadecimal, or character) instantly updates all other representations.

- **ASCII & Cyrillic Display:**  
  Displays the corresponding ASCII character (or Cyrillic letter, if within the valid range) based on the current numeric input.

- **Interactive ASCII Table:**  
  A separate window displays the full ASCII table along with Cyrillic characters for easy reference.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  Built with Tkinter, the interface is designed to be clean, responsive, and intuitive.
